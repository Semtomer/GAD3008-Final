Final Project       
This game is inspired by gartic.io (https://gartic.io) but this game is a different game two players. There are 5 laps in the game. In each lap, the players must draw the objects mentioned at the beginning of the lap using geometric palettes within 1 minute. In the meantime, the players can chat with the other player using chat. At the end of the lap, the players see the objects drawn by the other player and score out of 10 according to the similarity to the desired object at the beginning of the lap then the new lap begins. The player with the most points at the end of 5 laps wins the game. 

Mouse Left Click --> Chooses one of the geometric shapes in the geometric palette.    
Tab --> Sends the message that the player wrote.      
Note: If you want to delete the geometric shape that you accidentally drew, select the geometric shape at the bottom right of the geometric palette.
